# Vaccination Landing Page

You can visit the landing page here: [Vaccination](https://khisus19.github.io/vaccination-landing-page/)

The goal of this page is to bring us closer to the end of the COVID-19 pandemic by achieving herd immunity. In countries that reached the highest levels of vaccination, death rates plummeted.

We need to tackle vaccine hesitancy with information. That is why we have planned the following strategies to raise the number of doses administrated.

The campaign consists in a series of flyers and ads posted on social media like Instagram, Facebook and Twitter; and websites where the main traffic are people withing our target audience (see below).
